# Example Google Sheet Data

This is an example of how your Google Sheet should look.

## Sheet Structure

**Sheet Name:** My To-Do List

**Columns:**
- Column A: Task (text)
- Column B: Status (empty or "done")

## Sample Data

| Task                          | Status |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| Review quarterly reports      |        |
| Update server documentation   | done   |
| Order new keyboard            |        |
| Schedule team meeting         |        |
| Backup important files        | done   |
| Call IT vendor                |        |
| Submit expense report         | done   |
| Plan next sprint              |        |
| Test new feature              |        |
| Write project proposal        |        |

## Tips

1. **Keep tasks concise** - Aim for 50 characters or less for best display
2. **Mark completed** - Type exactly "done" (lowercase) in Status column
3. **Delete old tasks** - Remove completed tasks periodically to keep list fresh
4. **Add freely** - You can add tasks from phone, tablet, or computer
5. **Update anytime** - Changes will appear on next hourly refresh
